<h1>How does eBay buyer protection work?</h1>

<h2>1. Contact the seller</h2>
If your item hasn't arrived or isn't as described, contact the seller first. Give them a chance to make things right for you.

<h2>2. Still not resolved? Get assistance from customer service</h2>
Our customer support specialists are here to help. Just contact us if your item hasn't arrived or isn't as described to open a case. We're available from 5:00 AM-10:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST), every day.

<h2>3. We'll work with the seller to resolve the issue</h2>
We'll contact the seller and ask them to resolve the issue. After 7 days (or 10 days, in case of international transactions), we'll ask you how it's going with the seller. If you tell us that the problem cannot be resolved between you and the seller, and your case qualifies for and is covered by eBay Buyer Protection, eBay will refund your full purchase price plus original shipping into your PayPal account.
