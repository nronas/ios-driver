<h1>Step-by-step guide to buyer protection</h1>

<h2>1. Before you buy</h2>
Check the item listing. Review the seller's Feedback, terms of sale, item description, and shipping and payment methods. Make sure you're comfortable with the item and the terms the seller is offering.

<h2>2. Allow enough time to receive an item</h2>
Keep in mind the seller needs time to receive and confirm payment and ship the item. Delivery time may also depend on border delays if the item is coming from another country.

<h2>3. Email the seller, and make sure the seller can reach you</h2>
Follow up with the seller to get answers to your concerns. You can <a href=”http://pages.ebay.ca/help/buy/contact.html#getting”>request the seller's email address</a> or use the <b>Ask a question</b> link in the listing. <br>
Check your email spam filter for messages. The seller may be trying to email you, but spam filters may be blocking the messages.<br>
Check your own contact information. It's possible that the seller is trying to email you, but your contact information is out of date. To check or change your email address, go to the <b>Account</b> tab in My eBay and click the <b>Personal Information link</b>.

<h2>4. Call your seller</h2>
Request the <a href=”http://pages.ebay.ca/help/buy/contact.html#getting”>seller's contact information</a> and give the seller a call.

<h2>5. Go to the eBay Resolution Centre</h2>
If you're not able to work things out with the seller, go to the <a href=”http://resolutioncentre.ebay.ca/”>eBay Resolution Centre</a>. The centre will track steps that have been taken to resolve the problem. If you bought an item through PayPal, you'll automatically be directed to the PayPal Resolution Centre.<br>
<b>Important</b>: You can open a case only through the eBay country site where you purchased the item. Also, keep in mind there are deadlines for opening a case – usually within 45 days of the listing ending.

<h2>6. Contact your credit card company</h2>
If we can't help you, your credit card company may be able to. Most credit card companies provide some level of purchase protection. Contact your credit card company to learn more.

<h2>7. Leave Feedback</h2>
Leave honest, fair, factual Feedback. This will let other members know about your experience with the seller and help keep eBay a safe place to buy and sell.
