        law that applies to eBay, you will be entitled to the benefit of certain warranties under that legislation.  For more information on consumer

        <b>Limitation of Liability.</b>

        contract, tort or otherwise (including by way of clarification but not limitation, any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special or
exemplary damages) arising from your use or misuse of this Application or from the interruption, suspension, or termination of this Application (“        <b>Claim</b>”), suffered or incurred by you.  Notwithstanding the above provisions, nothing in this Terms of Use is intended to limit or exclude any
        liability on the part of eBay and its Affiliates where and to the extent that applicable law prohibits such exclusion or limitation including those
        within the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and relevant state fair trading legislation.  For example, if eBay is found (by judgment of a court of
        competent jurisdiction) to have breached a warranty or condition implied by law, and you are considered a consumer for the purpose of that law, then
        the limitation of liability in this clause will not apply to you.  For more information on consumer protection laws please visit www.accc.gov.au or the
        website of your state fair trading agency, or consult with a legal practitioner.
