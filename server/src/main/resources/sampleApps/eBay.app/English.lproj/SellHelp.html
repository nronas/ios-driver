<h2>Selling Research</h2>
Search completed listings to find final sale prices of items similar to the one you are selling. This will help you determine your starting bid and Buy It Now price.

<a name="title"></a>
<h2>Title</h2>
A title is a short description of the item you're selling. Writing a good title is important because <b>buyers find listings based on titles</b>. Titles can be up to 80 characters long. When creating a title, use multiple descriptive keywords that clearly convey what you are selling.

<a name="subtitle"></a>
<h2>Subtitle</h2>
Capture the interest of buyers when they view search results (in list view) by displaying more information below your title.
    
<a name="category"></a>
<h2>Category</h2>
Select the eBay category where your listing will appear. When you select the most appropriate category to list your item in, you make it easier for buyers to find it.

<a name="pictures"></a>
<h2>Pictures</h2>
On eBay, a picture really is worth a thousand words &mdash; <b>buyers want to see what an item looks like before they bid or buy</b>. Include pictures of your item to greatly increase your chances of success.

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>To add a picture, tap on an empty space. You can take a picture using your phone's camera or select a picture from your phone's photo album.</li>
<li>To remove a picture, tap on it and confirm.</li>
<li>To reorder pictures, hold on the picture and drag.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Photo do's</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Use proper lighting to light the entire item thoroughly.</li>
	<li>Try to use a background that contrasts with the item.</li>
	<li>Use a plain, colored fabric backdrop to make your item stand out. Pure white backgrounds are great for very dark items and sometimes jewelry.</li>
	<li>Avoid background clutter that can distract buyers or confuse them regarding what you're selling.</li>
	<li>Photograph items at close range and at an angle.</li>
	<li>Photos should be big enough to show details and fill the whole frame when appropriate.</li>
	<li>Multiple photos enable buyers to see as much detail as possible. For example, provide details on tabs, labels, original packaging, and accessories.</li>
	<li>Include scale where appropriate.</li>
	<li>If the item has any flaws, wear, or damage, be sure to document it with a photo.</li>
	<li>Consider using a tripod to take sharp pictures using indoor lighting without flash. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Photo don'ts</h3>
<ul>
		<li>Don't copy pictures (without permission) from another seller or manufacturer/retailer. </li>
</ul>

<a name="description"></a>
<h2>Item Description</h2>
An item's description provides buyers with comprehensive details about your item. To help buyers make an informed buying decision, include accurate details of your item's condition, any item defects and other relevant information like brand names, model numbers and dimensions.

<p>Once the item is listed, you can revise the item's description from the eBay web site to add additional details.</p>

<a name="condition"></a>
<h2>Condition</h2>
Some listing categories require you to classify the condition of the item you are selling. Please review the available options and select the item condition which best represents your item.

<a name="specifics"></a>
<h2>Item Specifics</h2>
Some listing categories allow you to provide additional specific details regarding your item. By providing additional specifics, you provide potential buyers with more information as well as make it easier for them to find your item.

<p>Item specifics may be either recommended or required. If they are required, you must provide them in order to complete your listing. Required item specifics (if any) are grouped separately from recommended item specifics in the item specifics picker.</p>

<a name="price"></a>
<h2>Price</h2>

Enter a price in one or more of the price fields. You can create the following auction formats:

<ul>
<li><b>Auction</b>: In the Auction tab, enter a price in only the "Auction start price" field</li>
<li><b>Auction+Buy It Now</b>: In the Auction tab, enter a price in both the "Auction start price" and "Buy It Now" fields</li>
<li><b>Fixed Price</b>: In the Fixed Price tab, enter a price in the "Buy It Now" field</li>
</ul>

<a name="quantity"></a>
<h2>Quantity</h2>

Specifying a quantity of items is only available for the Fixed Price listing format. To sell more than one item at a time, select the Fixed Price listing format and enter the quantity of items you wish to sell in the Quantity field beneath the Buy It Now price.

<a name="reserve_price"></a>
<h2>Reserve Price</h2>

Specifying a reserve price is only applicable to Auction format listings with or without a Buy It Now price. If you do specify a Buy It Now price, the reserve price must be lower than the Buy It Now price. In all cases, the reserve price must be greater than the auction start price. At the end of the auction, if the highest bid is lower than the reserve price, the item will not have been sold. 

<a name="best_offer"></a>
<h2>Best Offer</h2>

Are you willing to consider offers for your item below your Buy It Now price? If so, include the Best Offer option in your listing.

<p>How it works:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buyers can click a "Submit your Best Offer" link in your listing and specify a price they are willing to pay.</li>
<li>You will receive an email message and a push notification when there is an offer and have 48 hours to accept or decline. You can also set prices at which offers will be automatically accepted or declined (If the buyer has specified additional terms, you will still need to personally review and accept the offer.).</li>
<li>If you accept the offer, the listing ends immediately, and the buyer is directed to pay you. If you've chosen to automatically accept offers, you can also choose to have the invoice sent automatically.</li>
</ul>

<a name="immediate_payment"></a>
<h2>Requiring Immediate Payment</h2>
<p>When this option is available, you may choose to require immediate payment for Fixed Price and Buy It Now listings. If a Buy It Now item ends as an auction, the immediate payment requirement does not apply. It also does not apply to Best Offers accepted for an immediate payment listing.</p>

<p>There are several requirements which apply to immediate payment listings. Some of them are listed here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The listing category must support immediate payment</li>
<li>You must accept PayPal as a payment method</li>
<li>The site you are listing the item on must support immediate payment</li>
<li>You must have a Business or Premiere PayPal account and be in good standing with eBay</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information regarding immediate payment, please visit the eBay web site.</p>

<a name="private_listings"></a>
<h2>Private Listings</h2>
<p>If you'd like your buyers' identities to remain anonymous, you can create a private listing.</p>
<p>While there are some cases where private listings are appropriate, such as the sale of high-priced ticket items or approved pharmaceutical products, you should only make your listing private if you have a specific reason.</p>
-->
    
<a name="schedule"></a>
<h2>Schedule</h2>


<h3>Duration</h3>
<p>Select how long your listing will run. In general, a longer duration results in higher prices or increases the chances of a sale.</p>

<h3>Start time</h3>
<p>For an additional fee, you can schedule your listing to start on a day and time of your choice.</p>

<a name="shipping"></a>
<h2>Shipping</h2>
Specifying shipping costs in your listing is vital to your success &mdash; buyers want to know the total cost of the item before bidding or buying. 

You can add multiple shipping options to give buyers a choice of services and costs.

<a name="settings"></a>
<h2>Handling time</h2>
Specify the handling time for processing an order after a buyer has paid for one of your items. Handling time specified here will be applied to all listings.

<a name="location"></a>
<h2>Item location</h2>    
<p>Specify the location from which your item will be shipped.</p>
<p>Attract more buyers by specifying the ZIP Code where your item is located. Your item will appear both in regular searches and when buyers search by distance from their location.</p>
<p>Select the &ldquo;Local pickup&rdquo; check box to offer local pickup to buyers who live near you. This will help the buyer save on shipping costs.
    You'll especially benefit if you're selling large, heavy, or fragile items. Many buyers want to purchase these items locally and pick them up.</p>
    
<h2>Return policy</h2>
Specify the return policy for your items. You can either specify that returns are not accepted, or if you do accept returns,
choose how long after purchase to accept returns, how the money is returned, and who pays the shipping costs for the return. Generally, items with clearly spelled out return policies outsell similar items without that information. Return policies configured here will be applied to all listings.

<h2>Title suggestions</h2>
When typing in the title for items you are about to sell, the application will suggest popular items from the eBay catalog
that match what you have typed so far. You can turn this feature off with this setting switch.
