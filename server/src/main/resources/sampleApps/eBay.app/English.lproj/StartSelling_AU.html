<b>Prefill item details from an eBay product</b></br>
Tap on the Sell tab at the bottom of the screen to go to the Sell screen, then tap the "List your item" button to go to the "List an Item" screen. As you start typing in the Title text field, 
a drop down list of product names is displayed under it. If the product name matches the item you're 
selling, select it. This displays the details of the selected catalog product. 
To use the displayed product's details to prefill your item listing, tap on the prefill button. 
This action prefills your listing's title, product information and the listing category, and returns you to the 
"List an Item" screen where you can enter the rest of the listing details.

<b>Scan a barcode to prefill item details</b></br>
In Australia, the eBay app currently supports pre-filling item details for most books available in the Australian market.  Other categories are currently being tested. 
Tap on the Sell tab at the bottom of the screen to go to the Sell screen, then tap the "List your item" button to go to the "List an Item" screen. 
From this screen, tap on the button that has a barcode image on it. This launches the barcode scanning screen. 
Align the lines on the screen with the top and bottom edge of the barcode. Make sure there is no glare on the barcode. 
A beep is heard when the app recognizes the barcode. If there is a matching product available in the eBay catalog, its details will be added to your listing.
