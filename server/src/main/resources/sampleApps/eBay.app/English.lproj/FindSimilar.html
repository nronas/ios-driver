<h3>Find items like the one you're selling and research sale trends</h3>
Tap on the Sell tab at the bottom of the screen to go to 
the Sell screen. From here, you can search for items that have the same characteristics as the one 
you're listing. Begin your search by entering a keyword in the search field at the top of the screen and tapping on the Search button on the keyboard. 
You can make refinements, such as the eBay category to search on, by tapping the Refine button at the top of the search results screen.

<p>
<b>Scan a barcode to find similar items</b><br>
Scanning an item's barcode is an easy way of specifying information about items you're searching for. 
Tap on the barcode icon at the top right part of the Sell screen to launch the barcode scanning screen. 
Align the lines on the screen with the top and bottom edge of the barcode. Make sure there is no glare on the barcode. 
A beep is heard when the barcode is successfully scanned. If a corresponding product is found in the eBay catalog, items matching the product are displayed.
</p>

<p><b>Narrow your search results</b><br>
To find the selling price of sold items, refine your search so the Completed listings selector and the Sold items only 
selector are turned ON. These are the default settings for searches performed in the Sell screen.  
You can refine your search further by tapping the Refine button at the top of the search results screen.
</p>
<p>
<b>Sell one like this</b><br>
Once you find an item that is similar to yours, tap on it. 
This takes you to the Item screen. Here you can view the item's listing information and 
the sold price if the item was purchased. To view the item's seller specified description, 
tap on the Description link. If the item you're listing is very much like the current item, 
tap on the Sell one like this button. This action prefills item details from the current item into your 
listing and takes you to the Sell screen to continue your listing process.
